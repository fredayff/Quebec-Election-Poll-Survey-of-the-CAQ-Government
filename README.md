# Quebec-Election:Poll Survey of the CAQ Government

# Introduction

In this polling research, we developed a survey and simulated 10000 responses for each concerned question. The probabilities of the voters choosing each of the options were considered carefully under the researches of real data, therefore, this polling research is reliable and reflective on the real population. We also summarized the statistics into plots and pie graphs to help our client create a better vision on polling data.

Moreover, in order to develop an in-depth understanding of the attitudes, needs, and voting behaviours of potential voters in Qu√©bec, we also combined the research results with the sources of public opinions in the discussion section. The aim was to provide the client with our recommendations on achieving success in future elections.
